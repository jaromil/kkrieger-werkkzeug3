   * Started ChangeLog for recording per-file changes in the project.
     We could get away without ChangeLog at all (use CVS logs), but we
     lose CVS so often its better to have log glued to the sources =)
     You should record changes in CHANGES also, not for every change
     but rather when making a release.
