 * instruction is a special operand type, whereas AX in other

 * shift instructions, DX in OUT, etc.)
 *
 * The basic concept here is that
 *    (class & ~operand) == 0
 *
 * if and only if "operand" belongs to class type "class".
 *
 * The bits are assigned as follows:
 *
 * Bits 0-7, 29: sizes
 *  0:  8 bits (BYTE)
 *  1: 16 bits (WORD)
 *  2: 32 bits (DWORD)
 *  3: 64 bits (QWORD)
 *  4: 80 bits (TWORD)
 *  5: FAR
 *  6: NEAR
 *  7: SHORT
 * 29: 128 bits (OWORD)
 *
 * Bits 8-11 modifiers
 *  8: TO
 *  9: COLON
 * 10: STRICT
 * 11: (reserved)
 *
 * Bits 12-15: type of operand
 * 12: REGISTER
 * 13: IMMEDIATE
 * 14: MEMORY (always has REGMEM attribute as well)
 * 15: REGMEM (valid EA operand)
 *
 * Bits 16-19: subclasses
 * With REG_CDT:
 * 16: REG_CREG (CRx)
 * 17: REG_DREG (DRx)
 * 18: REG_TREG (TRx)

 * With REG_GPR:
 * 16: REG_ACCUM (AL, AX, EAX, RAX)
 * 17: REG_COUNT (CL, CX, ECX, RCX)
 * 18: REG_DATA  (DL, DX, EDX, RDX)
 * 19: REG_HIGH  (AH, CH, DH, BH)
 *
 * With REG_SREG:
 * 16: REG_CS
 * 17: REG_DESS (DS, ES, SS)
 * 18: REG_FSGS
 * 19: REG_SEG67
 *
 * With FPUREG:
 * 16: FPU0
 *
 * With XMMREG:
 * 16: XMM0
 *
 * With MEMORY:
 * 16: MEM_OFFS (this is a simple offset)
 * 17: IP_REL (IP-relative offset)
 *
 * With IMMEDIATE:
 * 16: UNITY (1)
 * 17: BYTENESS (-128..127)
 *
 * Bits 20-26: register classes
 * 20: REG_CDT (CRx, DRx, TRx)
 * 21: RM_GPR (REG_GPR) (integer register)
 * 22: REG_SREG
 * 23: IP_REG (RIP or EIP) [unused]
 * 24: FPUREG
 * 25: RM_MMX (MMXREG)
 * 26: RM_XMM (XMMREG)
 *
 * Bits 27-29 & 31 are currently unallocated.
 *
 * 30: SAME_AS
 * Special flag only used in instruction patterns; means this operand
 * has to be identical to another operand.  Currently only supported
 * for registers.
